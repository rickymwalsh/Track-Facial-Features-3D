# Track-Facial-Features-3D

#### Statement of the problem
To measure the range of motion, patients are asked to move their tongue to standardized, extreme positions, left, right, forward, downward and upward. A triple camera system is used to measure the 3D positions of the tongue tip. Of course, to compare these positions, pre- and post-treatment, the positions should be expressed with reference to a fixed, well-defined coordinate system that is attached to the head. How to derive these measurements from the recorded triple videos? 

#### Assignment 
Develop and test a method that is able to track the tip of the tongue and some facial landmarks so as to find the 3D positions of these points. Using these facial landmarks, define a 3D reference coordinate system that is attached to the face. Express the 3D position of the tongue tip in that coordinate system. Evaluate the method.
